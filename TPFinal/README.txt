Overall Purpose: This project is intended to be a model of gravity in general, and happens to support a view of the solar system because
this is particularly relatable. I wanted to apply my knowledge of linear algebra, physics, and differential calculus to develop my 
project, so this one seemed like a good choice. Originally, I sought out to create a simple wireframe rendered, which actually 
went pretty smoothly, so I adapted that code into a general module for 3D simulations. In short, my project is a gravitational engine
in 3 dimensions that has a two-D display via Tkinter.

-Ok I won't lie, set-up for this project on other machines will be very challenging
-First you'll want to use python 3.5 (ish) and install PIL via the pillow fork from python2. This 
is much more complicated on windows machines, but essentially I used some pip commands from the command prompt and googled
Issues until I got this part working. On Unix this process is simple enough.
-Second, You'll need to get numpy for python 3+. This can be very annoying to get working, so I used miniconda on Windows
and conda on linux to make my life a bit easier. Tutorials can be found for either of these installs online.
-Third, you'll to place the folder named 'picfolder' in the same directory as your TP3.py file.
-Finally, just run TP3.py from whatever IDE you please.
-You can modify the parameters under 'init' (not under 'immutablePerams unless you want to see some stranger phenomena) 
if you so choose 

-Pillow, the fork I used for PIL, can be found at https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow
-Pillow install instructions can be found at http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.4.x/installation.html
-Numpy's libraries for windows can be found at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy
-Alternatively, install Numpy via Conda/miniConda (at http://conda.pydata.org/docs/)
